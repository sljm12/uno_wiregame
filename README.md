A touch the wire game using arduino uno

This is a game where you must navigate the Wire Maze using a loop without touching the maze.

My dad made a simpler version of this using just Wires, a battery pack and a light blub to indicate that you touched the wire.

This is my little tribute to him in a way, with some modern enhancements such as an Arduino UNO, buzzer and a 20x4 LCD.

## Parts List
* Arduino UNO (I used the Cytron Maker Uno because of the built in buzzer)
* 1.6mm Thick wire for making the Maze
* Electrical Tape
* 20x4 LCD for Scoring
